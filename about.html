                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <div class="text">A coffee break in the United States and elsewhere is a short
                    mid-morning rest period granted to employees in business and industry.
                    offee breaks usually last from 10 to 20 minutes and frequently occur at the
                    end of the first third of the work shift. coffee breaks may take place away
                    from the actual work-area in a designated cafeteria or tea room. More generally,
                    the phrase "coffee break" has also come to denote any break from work.
                    <br />
                    Whatever your coffee break is, get it where you want it.</div>
